0,hi I'm chef Brandon swallow from the Culinary Institute of America and I'm going to show you this kitchen basic how to work with garlic,1.14,7.75
1,NON-SPEECH,7.75,15.86
2,this is a head of garlic is what you're looking at right here so to break the cloves out of the head what I actually do is I use the weight of the hand and I heat put the heel of the hand onto the actual clove and just lean on and as you lean on it break that bulb up and you see that all these little individual pieces just kind of pop out and now you have what's known as the cloves,15.86,37.87
3,now that's your next challenge I'm going to use the larger knife I'm going to place it on top of that actual clove make sure that your knife is not angled up meaning the blade towards you I always do the blade away and always point it down I'm going to use the heel of this hand that I'm going to give it a firm little tap,37.87,56.15
4,with that little tap what happens is that cracks that outer skin of the clove,56.15,61.14
5,you notice that the ends already broken off the clove and you'll see that it kind of,61.14,65.74
6,it kind of opens the husk of it and then I can easily pull,65.74,70.219999
7,the clove outside of the husk and that root that holds it and now I have a fresh clove of garlic here we go I start at the edge,70.219999,78.96
8,and I want to actually slice as find vertical slices as I can by not going through the actual root of the garlic then I turn the garlic horizontally and I make a slice down the center,78.96,93.0
9,not going through the root keeping it intact I'm now going back with my,93.0,98.0
10,horizontal slices,98.0,99.33
11,NON-SPEECH,99.33,101.42
12,and I have minced garlic now pretty simple pretty fast and the last thing that I'm going to speak to you about garlic is the smell on your hands number one I know people that take the sea salt or kosher salt and use salt rub it from your hands as a stringent it does remove it,101.42,119.03999999999999
13,there's another one you could go to a stainless steel spoon you actually wash your hands and then rub them all over a stainless steel product it does help remove the smell of the garlic for more great tips log on to kitchen daily calm and peace you,119.03999999999999,136.76
