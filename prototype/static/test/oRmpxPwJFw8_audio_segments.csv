1,hi I'm fade a moyes on from social skills here to share with you how to set the table first things first get all of your supplies out and if you'd like practice at home with me you're going to need a knife a spoon and two forks for our table setting a meal plate a bread plate and napkin and a glass or two it's really easy to forget where things go and when you're at a table setting where there's a lot of people it's hard to remember which is your bread plate which are your glasses when things are really close together but I'm going to give you a few really simple tips that you're probably never going to forget number one how many letters is left have it has four so does the word fork so a good way to remember that Forks go on the left is that they both have four letters so go ahead and set up your Forks,4.99,51.68

4,appetizer fork and that goes,61.13,63.79
5,just to the left of your entrée fork and the idea is that as you're eating you're using your utensils from the outside in so you're starting with the utensils on the outside and working inward,63.79,76.69
6,now your knife and your spoon both have five letters and so does the word right so it's a really simple way to remember that your knife and your spoon go on the right side of the plate,76.69,88.05999999999999

8,typically a spoon is only used in a play setting for a soup or sometimes for pasta it's put out so if there is a soup spoon at your table setting you can pretty much assume that you're going to be having soup the meal plate goes right in the center,92.38,107.89
