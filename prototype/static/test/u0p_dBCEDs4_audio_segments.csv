1,if you ask 10 different cooks the perfect way to cook pasta you're probably going to get 10 different answers here at the test kitchen we decided it was time we made a video showing our method for making the perfect pot so let's get started first you've got to boil water a lot of people put olive oil in the pasta water because they think it will keep the pasta from sticking together but it actually doesn't all you're really doing is wasting good olive oil,4.92,28.689999999999998
2,the real way to stop pasta from sticking is to cook it in enough water we recommend four quarts of water per one pound of pasta,28.689999999999998,36.1
3,when it comes to salt think of pasta as a sponge whatever it touches it absorbs so put salt in the water because it will season the spaghetti while it cooks how much should you use through our tests we've found that one tablespoon of salt for four quarts of water is the best ratio,36.1,52.07
4,so once you've got this water and the salt sorted out add the pasta to the boiling water and stir it for a minute or two because this also helps keep from sticking together we recommend a pasta fork because wooden spoons tend to be clunky and don't separate the individual strands of pasta from each other,52.07,68.38
5,now how do you know when your pasta is done the timing instructions on the boxes are almost always wrong we've that it's best to actually taste the pasta to see if it's done if you like the texture when you taste it then you're good to go we like ours with a little bite in the center which is also known as al dente,68.38,86.059999
6,so now you've got to drain your pasta it might seem like the simplest step but there's actually a bit more to it than just dumping the water in the pasta out over the sink first be sure to reserve some of the cooking water about a cup before you drain it this water is full of flavor and it can help loosen up the sauce if it's too thick we even put a measuring cup in the strainer so that we don't forget,86.059999,108.02
7,also don't rinse the pasta you want some of the hot cooking water to stay on the strands because it helps the sauce coat it more evenly,108.02,115.55
8,now it's time to get saucy,115.55,117.82
9,once you've drained the pasta you have to dress it put it back in the empty pot and add the sauce then add some of the pasta water you set aside to get the right consistency doing all of this in the pot also helps keep the pasta warmer longer,117.82,131.96
10,and that is how you make a perfect pot of pasta,131.96,134.65
