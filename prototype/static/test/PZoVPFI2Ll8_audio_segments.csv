0,hey I'm Alex and this is my recipe for strawberry cheesecake pitbull,0.37,4.88
1,NON-SPEECH,4.88,8.87
2,so I need this recipe video at a time where cake rolls were kept,8.87,13.46
3,trendy they were like the in thing to do and I just wanted to play around with the flavors and create something that was delicious but also new and interesting so the process looks a little bit tricky when making a cake roll because there are a few components that you have to nail but it's actually pretty simple when you break it down so this cake batter calls for a lot of eggs it's kind of like a sponge cake now you want to make sure you're beating your eggs before you go on to adding any other ingredients because we're gonna incorporate some air into these eggs and it'll make for a fluffier cake,13.46,47.46
4,the rest is pretty simple you'll just stop in the rest of the ingredients and switch to a folding method just make sure we're not over beating our cake batter,47.46,56.68
5,also,56.68,56.72
6,NON-SPEECH,56.72,62.11
7,just keep an eye when you're baking this cake because it's so much thinner it cooks really fast so be careful not to burn your cake so now we get to some of the more important steps once your cake is baked you need to lay a clean dish towel on your surface sprinkle that with powdered sugar and then right when you take it out of the oven you're gonna flip your cake over on to that hole,62.11,85.08
8,and quickly roll it up while the cake is still hot because this will ensure once you cool it in that form that it will keep its roll shape without cracking a very important step,85.08,97.48
9,so we're quickly while it's still hot don't burn yourselves you probably won't it's fine but yeah the powdered sugar is there to make sure your cake doesn't stick to your towel so don't skip that part either and don't use flour cuz that's gross,97.48,110.17
10,so now your cake is cooling in its dish towel I went on to make the filling which is a simple kind of cheesecake frosting it's one of my all time favorites so can't go wrong so when you bring your cake back from the fridge you're gonna unroll it and it will still have like kind of a it still kind of like I don't know go up,110.17,128.99
11,cuz it's like,128.99,130.92
12,molded to the roundness,130.92,133.93
13,oh man,133.93,135.23
14,so,135.23,136.0
15,lather all that cheesecake frosting on to the surface of the cake you're gonna sprinkle on some strawberries and then it should be pretty easy from here on out you just roll the cake back up into its final form,136.0,150.84
16,this is like a shapeshifter,150.84,152.88
17,shapeshifter cake I sprinkled my cake with some more powdered sugar just to make sure the outside looked nice and you can also decorate it with some more like strawberries or maybe some whipped cream also another important step for this cake if you're gonna be serving it to be bola you want it to look really beautiful is to chop off the ends now I know it might seem wasteful but you're really gonna get the best visual of that swirl when you chop off the extra bits on end but you also get that tasty visual,152.88,184.03
18,NON-SPEECH,184.03,186.27
19,you can just eat them as a snack,186.27,189.04
20,I did,189.04,190.73
21,I don't know why I always do this,190.73,193.44
22,all the sudden it's like my signature,193.44,195.44
