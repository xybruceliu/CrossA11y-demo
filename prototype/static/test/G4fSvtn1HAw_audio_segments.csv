0,today I'm going to show you how to make chocolate chip cookies but not just any ordinary chocolate chip cookie what I consider to be the perfect chocolate chip cookie,0.53,8.71
1,these are the ingredients that you'll need,8.71,11.21
2,and let's get started,11.21,12.82
3,I'm going to start off with two four point four ounce her she's chocolate bars I'm using one milk chocolate and one dark chocolate and I'm along going to be using three quarters of each bar,12.82,24.96
4,and I'm just going to chop these into pieces,24.96,27.240000000000002
5,and then put them into a bowl and set them off to the side,27.240000000000002,29.48
6,NON-SPEECH,29.48,32.21
7,now I'm going to take my butter and I've put it into a bowl I am using frozen butter this is how I prefer to make them I'm just going to put this in the microwave just until it is barely melted and looks like this,32.21,43.86
8,now I'm going to put the butter into the bowl of my stand mixer you can also use a bowl with an electric can meter that's mine and I'm just going to mix this until the melted butter is back incorporated with the solid butter,43.86,54.049999
9,and I'm going to add in my white sugar,54.049999,57.0
10,and my brown sugar,57.0,59.06
11,and I'm going to turn this on medium and I'm going to beat this until the sugars are dissolved into the butter,59.06,64.92
12,I'm gonna scrape the beater bar if my mixer as well as the bowl,64.92,67.52000000000001
13,NON-SPEECH,67.52000000000001,71.5
14,and I'm going to add in my vanilla,71.5,74.55
15,and I'm going to crack an egg into this,74.55,76.99
16,and I'm going to mix this just until the egg and vanilla is incorporated into the butter and sugar no more than 20 seconds max,76.99,83.28
17,NON-SPEECH,83.28,85.309999
18,and again I'm scrape down the beater as well as the bowl because we are done with the mixer,85.309999,89.23999900000001
19,NON-SPEECH,89.23999900000001,92.23999900000001
20,now to add in my flour,92.23999900000001,93.85000000000001
21,NON-SPEECH,93.85000000000001,97.8
22,my salt,97.8,100.41
23,and my baking soda,100.41,103.4
24,and then using a wooden spoon I'm going to mix this until it forms a dough now when you make these you might be surprised at how loose and soft this dough is and that's what it's supposed to be,103.4,114.43
25,and to add in my chocolate chunks and to carefully stir those in,114.43,119.3
26,you want to be careful with the dough you don't want to over mix it and you don't want to break your chocolate out,119.3,124.139999
27,and when your chocolate is incorporated go ahead and cover the dough and put it into the refrigerator to chill thoroughly for at least four hours before you bake the cookies,124.139999,132.19
28,NON-SPEECH,132.19,134.37
29,then we're going to turn my oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and let that preheat,134.37,140.4
30,I'm going to take a spoonful of dough and I'm going to carefully roll this into a ball you don't want to overwork this dough,140.4,147.53
31,and you want it to remain chilled as you're working with it,147.53,150.68
32,and then just gently flatten it out and put it onto a cookie sheet you want to space your cookies about four inches or so apart because they do spread when they bake,150.68,159.67
33,and to put them into the oven and I'm going to bake them for 12 minutes,159.67,164.59
34,and when they are done they will be just barely light brown around the edges you really do not want to over bake these and then go ahead and remove them to a cutting board to your counter to whatever I don't suggest a wire rack for these because they are soft,164.59,179.699999
35,and there you have it how to make what I consider to be the perfect chocolate chip cookie hope you guys enjoy and thanks so much for watching,179.699999,186.79000000000002
